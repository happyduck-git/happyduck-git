 <h2> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm GG </h2>
 <h3> iOS Developer using Swift. </h3>
<p>
  Mainly use `UIKit`, also love to use `SwiftUI`.
<br>
  Time and promise is essential value when working with others. Therefore, I `complete tasks in a given time with good quality`.
<br>
  I do care for writing `maintainable and readable codes` for the future scalability.
 <br>
  To acheive maintanable and readable codes, I try to optimize my codes with:
<li>MVVM pattern</li>
<li>Protocols</li>
<li>OOP principles(encapsulation, inheritances, etc.)</li>
</p> 
<p>
I try not to depend heavily on 3rd party frameworks unless they are very essenstial to my projects. 
<br>
 Still there some that I always feel thanksful for:
<li>Nuke, Gifu, Lottie, RxSwift, Firebase, Supabase</li>
  
</p>
<p>
Also interested in VisionOS. Love to hear and share about the knowledege.  
<br>
Thank you for reading!
