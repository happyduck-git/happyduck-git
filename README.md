 <h2> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm GG. </h2>
 <h5> iOS Developer</h5>
 <h3> Passionately Driven by Learning and Committed to High Quality </h3>
<p> 
 
 Mainly use `UIKit`, also love to use `SwiftUI`.
<br> Time and promise are essential values when working with others.
Therefore, I `complete tasks in a given time` with `good quality`.
<br> I care for writing `maintainable` and `readable codes` for the future scalability.

  To acheive maintainable and readable codes, I optimize my codes by adopting:
<li>MVVM pattern, Protocols, OOP principles</li>
</p> 
<p>
I try not to depend heavily on 3rd party frameworks unless they are very essenstial to my projects. 
<br>
 Still there some that I always feel thankful for:
<li>Nuke, Gifu, Lottie, RxSwift, Firebase, Supabase</li>
  
</p>
<p>
Also interested in VisionOS. Love to hear and share about the knowledge  
<br>
Thank you for reading!
